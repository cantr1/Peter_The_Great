    <h2 class="subtitle">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Peter the Great (Russian: Пётр Вели́кий), Peter I (Russian: Пётр Первый,) or Pyotr Alekseevich (Russian: Пётр Алексе́евич) 9 June [O.S. 30 May] 1672 – 8 February [O.S. 28 January] 1725)
        ruled the Tsardom of Russia and later the Russian Empire from 7 May [O.S. 27 April] 1682 until his death in 1725, jointly ruling before 1696 with his elder half-brother, Ivan V.
        Through a number of successful wars, he expanded the Tsardom into a much larger empire that became a major European power and also laid the groundwork for the Imperial Russian Navy after capturing ports at Azov and the Baltic Sea.
        He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political systems with ones that were modern, scientific, Westernised and based on the Enlightenment.[1]
        Peter's reforms had a lasting impact on Russia, and many institutions of the Russian government trace their origins to his reign. He is also known for founding and developing the city of Saint Petersburg, which remained the capital of Russia until 1917.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Named after the apostle, and described as a newborn as "with good health, his mother's black, vaguely Tatar eyes, and a tuft of auburn hair", from an early age Peter's education (commissioned by his father, Tsar Alexis of Russia) was put in the hands of several tutors,
        most notably Nikita Zotov, Patrick Gordon, and Paul Menesius. On 29 January 1676, Tsar Alexis died, leaving the sovereignty to Peter's elder half-brother, the weak and sickly Feodor III of Russia. Throughout this period, the government was largely run by Artamon Matveev,
        an enlightened friend of Alexis, the political head of the Naryshkin family and one of Peter's greatest childhood benefactors.

    <h2 class="subtitle">Death</h2>
      <p>
        In the winter of 1723, Peter, whose overall health was never robust, began having problems with his urinary tract and bladder. In the summer of 1724, a team of doctors performed surgery releasing upwards of four pounds of blocked urine.
        Peter remained bedridden until late autumn. In the first week of October, restless and certain he was cured, Peter began a lengthy inspection tour of various projects. According to legend, in November, at Lakhta along the Finnish Gulf to inspect some ironworks,
        Peter saw a group of soldiers drowning near shore and, wading out into near-waist deep water, came to their rescue.
